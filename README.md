Basically I am trying to understatnd how express works and missing something fundimental.

Data needed for project

Currently stored in blog/dump

Data backed up using
 mongodump -h localhost -d m101

 Data restored using
 mongorestore -d m101 -c tapes

 To see what my question is simply start the app using "node app.js from within the blog directory
 Open a browser to localhost:3001
 Notice what works and doesn't.
 Explain what I am doing wrong or change it so it all works (i.e. localhost:3001/XXX resolves)

 As a side my real project is to create a CRUD for the tapes collection
